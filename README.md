================

Drag and drop dynamic bootstrap forms with angular.

## Description

FebWorms allows the most _stupidious_ users to design forms in a _bob-ross-wysiwyg_ environment. 
Field components can be dragged from a _pallette_ onto a _canvas_ where details like _validation_, _dragons_ and _ponies_ can be fine-tuned further.
Developers can extend the editor by adding _magic_ like custom field components and _validation patterns_.


This module was primarily written for the _ministry of defense_ -- and they are _true_ die hards when it comes to forms (or ponies).
