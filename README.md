================

Drag and drop dynamic bootstrap forms with angular.

## Description

FebWorms allows the most _stupidious_ users to design forms in a _bob-ross-wysiwyg_ environment. 
Field components can be dragged from a _pallette_ onto a _canvas_ where details like _validation_ and _dragons_ can be fine tuned.
Developers can extend the editor by adding _magic_ like custom field components and _validation patterns_.


This module was primarily written for the ministery of defense -- and they are die hards when it comes to forms.
